I am creating my first web application in which you can publish your articles,
update / delete your articles, but for publishing your articles you must sign-up, 
there is also an admin panel. Helps me with this: Flask, SQLAlchemy, WTForms,
to begin with took the SQlite3 database, also Alembic for database migration.
A little HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

you can see my project in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDitd__Hsxo

## If you want starting my project you must do:
* Instaling Python
* git clone https://github.com/SlavaGolovatskyu/Project-for-blogs.git
* cd Project-for-blogs
* python auto_install_modules.py
* python runner.py shell
* db.create_all()
* exit()
* python runner.py runserver
